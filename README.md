🚗 Vehicle Density Prediction

📌 Overview
This project uses computer vision and deep learning to predict vehicle density in surveillance footage or live video streams. It can detect and count vehicles in real-time and estimate how congested a road is based on the number of vehicles per area.

This kind of system can help in:

Smart traffic control

Congestion monitoring

Urban planning

Emergency route management

🎯 Key Features
Real-time vehicle detection from video

Density classification: Low / Medium / High

Visual display with bounding boxes

Frame-by-frame vehicle counting

Easy to run and adapt for any video feed

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3
OpenCV – For video and image processing
TensorFlow / PyTorch – Deep learning model (YOLO, MobileNet, etc.)
NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

🔍 How It Works
The system captures video frames.

Each frame is passed through a deep learning model (e.g., YOLO) to detect vehicles.

The number of detected vehicles is counted.

Based on the count, the frame is classified as:

🚦 Low Density (0–5 vehicles)

🚧 Medium Density (6–15 vehicles)

🔴 High Density (16+ vehicles)

The result is displayed with bounding boxes and density label.

📈 Sample Output

[✓] Frame: 152

[✓] Detected Vehicles: 12

[✓] Density Level: MEDIUM

🧪 Model
You can use any pre-trained object detection model like:

YOLOv5

SSD with MobileNet

Faster R-CNN

Modify vehicle_detection.py to plug in your model.
